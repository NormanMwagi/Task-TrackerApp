# Project Title

Todo Tracker is a task management app that lets users add, edit, delete, and track todos with due dates. It features secure authentication, allowing access to the dashboard only when logged in. The dashboard also includes a progress report showing total tasks, completed tasks, completion rate, and overdue items.
